## Powerups
Bouncy paddles (add spring constant into the paddles)

Accelerating angular velocity question mark?


## Logistics
Both players can go around the circumfrance, put one slightly radially 
further than the other so that they don't collide

Constrain them to a circle each

Sound effects?

Start screen with option to change the parameters

## Harder game play
Adding potential (poles)
